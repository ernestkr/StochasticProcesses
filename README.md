# Intro

This Repository is mostly to explore the properties of Birth Death Proceesses. 
Here you may find some simulating methods as well as statistical methods that might help
with the estimation of some parameters. 

As this is an educational repository without much use but simple experimentation please do
tread with care. 

This is a specific case of Markov Chains. The methods implemented here might be of
interest to creditting systems that try to approximate the generator matrix(the matrix of
transition rates) when modelling defaulting problems.
